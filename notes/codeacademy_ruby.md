# RB 100 Notes
## Hashes
### Hash literal notation
- `new_hash = { "one" => 1}`
- First item is a *key* => (hash rocket) *value*
### Hash constructor notation
- `new_hash = Hash.new`
## Miscellaneous
### Non-true values (only two)
- `nil` = nothing at all
- `false` = not true
- They are *not* the same
## Symbols
- Always start with a `:`
- Primarily used as hash keys or for referencing method names
- Symbols are **immutable**
